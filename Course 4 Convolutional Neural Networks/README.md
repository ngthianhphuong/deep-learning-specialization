# Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

## [Programming Assignment 1: Convolutional Neural Network: step by step](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%204%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/W1%20Convolution%20model%20Step%20by%20Step%20%26%20Application)
Implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation.

## [Programming Assignment 2: Convolutional Neural Network: application](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%204%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/W1%20Convolution%20model%20Step%20by%20Step%20%26%20Application)
Skills learned:
- Implement helper functions that you will use when implementing a TensorFlow model
- Implement a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow

## [Programming Assignment 3: Keras basics](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%204%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/W2%20Keras%20Tutorial)
- Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK.
- Build a deep learning algorithm using Keras

## [Programming Assignment 4: Residual Networks](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%204%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/W2%20Residual%20Network)
- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
