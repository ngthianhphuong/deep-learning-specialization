# Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning


## [Programming Assignment 1: Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%201%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression%20with%20a%20Neural%20Network%20mindset)
First image recognition algorithm: a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy.
Skills learned:
- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.

## [Programming Assignment 2: Planar data classification with a hidden layer](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%201%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer)
Generate red and blue points to form a flower. Then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. Try different layers and see the results.
Skills learned:
- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.

- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.

- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.

## [Programming Assignment 3: Building your deep neural network: Step by Step](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%201%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Building)
Implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next assignment to build a neural network of any architecture. 
Skills learned:
- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.

## [Programming Assignment 4: Deep Neural Network Application](https://github.com/ngthianhphuong/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Course%201%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Learning%20Network%20-%20Application)
Build a deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images with >80% accuracy.
Skills learned:
- Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.

- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
